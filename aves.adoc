== System Architecture
=== Memory Architecture
==== Memory Map
All devices implement the following memory layout:

* Fixed RAM from 0x0000 to 0x7FFF
* Three memory architecture types:
** Linear 31.5K EPROM from 0x8000 to 0xFDFF
** Banked 128K Flash EEPROM and 128K RAM in same 31.5K space
** Segmented 512K RAM, 128K Flash EEPROM, with same linear architecture in segment 0
