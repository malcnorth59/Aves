=== Structural Issues
==== Organization
* State management and error handling sections should be grouped
* Protocol initialization and reset behavior needs consolidation
* Bus turnaround information appears in multiple sections

==== Flow
* Initial device state description should precede transaction details
* Error handling should follow normal operation description
* Reset behavior should be described after normal operation

# In protocol_architecture.adoc
=== Device States and Initialization
// Move power-on and reset content from various sections here
// Move initialization sequence here
[Move content from existing initialization sections]

==== Responder Device States
// Move existing state diagram and descriptions
[Move existing responder state content]

==== Controller Device States
// Move existing controller state content
// Include consolidated turnaround behavior
[Move existing controller state content]

==== Bus Turnaround Management
// Consolidate all turnaround-related content here
[Collect and move turnaround content]
