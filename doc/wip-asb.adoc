== Document Review Findings

=== Duplicated Content
* Protocol Performance Comparison section duplicated verbatim
* Controller Transaction Protocol section duplicated
* Bus turnaround descriptions appear in multiple sections with overlapping content

=== Technical Accuracy Issues
==== Frame Format
* Inconsistent CRC placement between sections
* Need to standardize on end-of-frame CRC placement

==== State Descriptions
* IDLE and offline state descriptions need alignment
* State diagrams require update to show offline state

==== Error Handling
* Multiple error handling sections need consolidation
* Need consistent description of return-to-idle behavior

=== Content Gaps
==== Device States
* Relationship between IDLE and offline states needs clear definition
* Initial state and ATN/ACK requirement should be introduced earlier

==== Timing
* Connection between physical layer timing (100Âµs timeout) and error recovery needs expansion
* Bus turnaround timing specifications need consolidation

=== Structural Issues
==== Organization
* State management and error handling sections should be grouped
* Protocol initialization and reset behavior needs consolidation
* Bus turnaround information appears in multiple sections

==== Flow
* Initial device state description should precede transaction details
* Error handling should follow normal operation description
* Reset behavior should be described after normal operation
