=== Flap Transport Protocol
The transport protocol ensures reliable end-to-end data exchange between devices on the ASB bus. It manages the handshaking sequence, flow control, and connection states required for dependable communication between controller and responder devices.

----

==== Initialize Transaction
1. Send ATN pulse
2. Wait for ACK Pulse

==== Command/Data Transmission
1. Assert ATN (low)
2. Command/Data

==== Turnaround
1. Wait for command acknowledge
2. Initialize listen
3. Send ATN pulse
4. Wait for data

==== End Transmission (EOI)
1. Pulse ATN
2. Wait for ACK
3. Send UNTALK command

==== End Listen (EOI)
1. Pulse ATN
2. Wait for ACK
3. Send UNLISTEN command

==== Protocol Features
* ATN pulse signaling for synchronization
* Handshake acknowledgment required
* Clear state transitions
* Explicit end-of-transmission handling
* Separate paths for transmit/listen completion
