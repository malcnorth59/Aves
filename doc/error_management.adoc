=== Error Management and Recovery

==== Error Types
* Initialization Timeout
** No devices responding error
** Occurs during initial ATN/ACK sequence
** Indicates no active devices on bus

* Device Command Timeout
** Device <n> not responding error
** Occurs during LISTEN, UNLISTEN, TALK, or UNTALK commands
** Indicates specific device failure or absence

* Transaction Timeout
** General timeout error
** Occurs during data transfer or turnaround
** Indicates communication failure during active transaction

==== Error Recovery Process
1. Error condition detected (>100Âµs timeout)
2. Both controller and responder:
   * Raise appropriate error type
   * Abort current transaction
   * Return to IDLE state

==== Implementation Benefits
* Error type indicates failure point
* Specific device identification when relevant
* Consistent recovery mechanism for all errors
* Enables targeted retry strategies

==== State Recovery
* All devices return to IDLE regardless of error type
* Higher layers can implement appropriate retry logic based on error type
* New transactions can begin immediately after timeout
