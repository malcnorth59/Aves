=== Bus Protocol States

==== Synchronization
* Every transaction begins with ATN/ACK handshake
* All devices synchronize at start of each transaction
* No edge cases possible - always returns to known state

==== State Management
* Only two primary states:
** IDLE (default state)
** ACTIVE (during transaction)
* All error conditions return to IDLE
* New transaction always starts with synchronization

==== Design Benefits
* Self-synchronizing protocol
* No ambiguous states possible
* Clean recovery from all error conditions
* Simple, deterministic behavior

=== Reset Sequence

==== Operation
* Sets all devices to IDLE state
* No handshaking required
* No acknowledgment needed

==== Device Response
* Immediate return to IDLE
* Clear any pending transactions
* Ready for new ATN/ACK sequence

That's all there is to it - simplicity is a feature here. The reset provides a clean slate without any complex negotiation or state management.
