Yes, I see the Memory Architecture section has been updated with the narrative introduction and includes the detailed Memory Control Register table. Would you like me to help expand the bank switching section further by:

. Adding a narrative description of how the bank switching mechanism operates in practice

. Explaining the relationships between the signals shown in the Standard Bank Switching Arrangement table

. Describing common use cases for the different window sizes (1K, 2K, 4K)

. Elaborating on the ROM write-through functionality and its applications

Or would you prefer to focus on a different aspect of the memory architecture? I notice we could also expand on:

. The memory types and configurations section which is currently just a placeholder

. The practical implications of the different banking modes

. The interaction between the banking system and interrupts

. How the window bits (W1b, W2b) can be used effectively in software
