= Aves Documentation
The documentation deatils in this document provide an index of all the documents created for the aves project. 

It is now necessary to consolidate all the documentation in to two multipart manuals

1. Hardware Manual - Covering the design of all of the Aves models
2. Software Manual - Covering the design, use and implementation of the kingfisher programmin language and tools

The following section provides guidelines. to follow to produce consistent documentation

== Documentation Structure Guidelines
The Kingfisher documentation format follows a structured approach with specific sections and formatting requirements.

=== Opening Section
The document begins with an introduction and smoothly transitions to the main subject matter, written in a narrative style.

Constructor documentation follows on directly after the opening section using a two-column table format, sorted alphabetically by Constructor with a bold title as shown below. 

All narrative should be kept ahead of the tables and examples, the exception being the use of [NOTE] if required after a table or code.

==== Multiple Tables and Examples
In some circumstances additional subheadings are required, but this should follow the same patterm with no lower than a level 4 heading. that is a section heading with narrative followed byt table(s) and examples.

.Constructor Definitions
|===
|Constructor|Description

|Constructor name with stack signature
|Description
|===

Methods and definition follow on directly from constructors using a similar style to constructors.

.Available Methods
[%header, cols="2,3"]
|===
|Operation|Description

|Operation name with stack signature
|Detailed explanation

|===

Code examples follow on from available operations in bold titles, unbreakable source code blocks. Examples should be the last item in section.

[%unbreakable]

.Basic Usage Example

=== Section Hierarchy
Section headings should follow these levels:
* Level 1: =
* Level 2: ==
* Level 3: ===
* Level 4: ====
* Beyond level 4: Use titles

=== Writing Style
The documentation should:

* Use British English spelling and conventions. Continue to use program rather than programme in the context of computer software
* Employ narrative form rather than bullet points where possible
* Avoid short, colon-terminated sentences
* Maintain a professional and comprehensive tone throughout
