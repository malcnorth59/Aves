[NOTE]
====
*Explanation:*

* Each column represents a time slot. There are 8 time slots per Phi2 cycle.

* The "_" and "/" characters are used to approximate the high and low states 
  of the signals. A continuous "_" represents a high state, and a "\" or "/" 
  represents a transition.

* Phi2 is the main clock.

* Slots 5, 6, and 7 are the outputs of the shift register. Notice how they 
  are offset in time.

* READY is low when *either* Slot 5, 6, or 7 is high *or* VIC Phi2 is high.

* BA and VACC are high when *either* Slot 6 or 7 is high.

* This diagram shows the *general timing relationship*. The *exact* 
  timing (pulse widths, etc.) will depend on the frequency of the 
  shift register clock and the specific taps you choose.

* This is still a simplified representation. A true timing diagram 
  would show more precise timing information and would likely be

== VIC Memory Access Timing Design

== Overview
The design provides precisely timed memory access slots for the VIC chip while maintaining synchronization with both the VIC clock and color clock domains.

== Clock Relationships
* VIC Clock: 7.88MHz (≈127ns period)
* Color Clock: 17.73MHz (≈56.39ns period)
* Ratio: 2.25:1
* Phase offset: 7ns per cycle

== Design Elements

=== Shift Register
* Clocked by 17.73MHz color clock
* Generates three sequential slots (5, 6, and 7)
* Each tap provides initial wide pulses
* Progressive timing reduction through stages:
** Slot 5: 35ns reduction
** Slot 6: 28ns reduction
** Slot 7: Subsequent reduction

=== Clock Synchronization
* Shift register outputs OR'd with VIC clock
* Ensures rising edge synchronization with VIC
* Guarantees trailing edge timing
* Prevents pulses from becoming too narrow

=== Timing Margins
* RAM requirement: 55ns
* Slot 6 example:
** Base pulse: 169ns
** Reduction: 28ns
** Final width: 141ns
** Margin: 86ns above requirement

== Key Benefits
* Reliable RAM access timing
* Maintained synchronization with VIC
* Generous timing margins
* Robust against clock domain interactions

== Implementation
The design uses standard TTL components:
* 17.73MHz crystal oscillator
* Shift register for slot generation
* OR gates for clock combination

This elegant solution provides precise memory access timing while bridging two clock domains, maintaining both reliability and synchronization.

/*********************************************************************
 * Video Memory Access Controller (VMAC)
 * 
 * Purpose:
 * Controls memory access arbitration between the CPU and video controller
 * supporting VIC (6561), VIC-II (6569), and TED (7360/8364) timing 
 * requirements.
 *
 * Timing Generation:
 * - External shift register delays the AEN signal
 * - Delayed AEN is OR'ed with original AEN to create timing slots
 * - This creates a pulse at the end of each clock cycle
 * - tsa/tsb are derived from this delayed timing chain
 *
 * VIC-II (6569) Operation:
 * - AEN indicates when VIC-II has control of the bus
 * - Can occur in both clock phases
 * - Shift register must use chroma clock for consistent timing
 *
 * VIC (6561) Operation:
 * - Video access occurs only during PHI1 (clock phase 1)
 * - PHI2 clock is used as input for AEN
 * - Phase-locked timing simplifies bus arbitration
 *
 * TED (7360/8364) Operation:
 * - Single 17.73MHz chroma clock source (PAL)
 * - System clock derived as 1.76MHz (÷10) or 0.88MHz (÷20)
 * - Video access during PHI1 like VIC
 * - Always 0.88MHz during video display
 * - Shift register must use chroma clock for consistent timing
 * - Clock division handled by TED internally

== Overview
Analysis of the VMAC design using aves-video-2.pld for VIC, VIC-II and TED support.

== Key Points
* Single GAL design works for all three video chips
* Uses 10-bit shift register for timing generation
* Operates from 17.73MHz chroma clock

== Timing Details
* Full cycle is 20 chroma clocks
** Each phase (PHI1/PHI2) is 10 cycles
** 17.73MHz ÷ 20 = 0.88MHz for TED
* Only using 8 bits of shift register
** Last 2 fastest bits not needed
** Slot 6 controls READY
** Slot 7 provides ~113ns margin

== Video Chip Support
VIC (6561)::
* PHI2 connected to AEN input
* Timing from slots 6/7

VIC-II (6569)::
* Direct AEN connection
* Timing from slots 6/7

TED (7360)::
* Clock-derived AEN
* Same slot 6/7 timing
* ~113ns margin from slot 7
* READY control from slot 6

== GAL Equations

ready = (tsa # aen) & iordy & exrdyin;
vacc  = !(tsb # aen);
exrdy = exrdyin & ready;
exba  = (tsb # aen);

== Key Benefits
* No GAL changes needed between chips
* External shift register handles timing differences
* Clean bus arbitration for all video chips
