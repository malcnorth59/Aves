== Physical Layer Specification

=== Physical Characteristics
* Half duplex communication using 65C22 VIA
* System clock (Phi2) requirement: 4MHz minimum
* Maximum data rate: 1Mbps

=== Hardware Implementation
* Pulsed handshake using edge-sensitive CA1/CA2 I/O
* External tristate buffers for I/O direction control
* Clock synchronization via Phi2-clocked latch

=== Network Topology
* Single controller architecture
* Supports up to 15 responder devices
* Each device uniquely addressable

=== Data Transfer
* Byte-by-byte transmission
* Each byte requires handshake acknowledgment
* Self-pacing through ACK mechanism
* No fixed timing requirements between bytes

=== Reliability Features
* Edge-triggered handshaking
* Hardware flow control via ACK
* Automatic speed matching to receiver capabilities
* Robust clock synchronization
