= System Architecture Overview

== Architectural Principles
Before delving into specific technical details, it's important to understand the fundamental design philosophies and architectural decisions that shape the Aves platform. These principles reflect both practical engineering considerations and broader goals for the system's role in modern retrocomputing.

The architecture of Aves represents a careful balance between preserving the elegant simplicity of classic 8-bit systems and incorporating modern design practices. Rather than simply replicating vintage hardware, each aspect of the system has been thoughtfully evaluated and, where appropriate, enhanced to meet contemporary needs while maintaining the spirit of its inspiration.

At the heart of Aves lies Considered Minimalism, where each component serves multiple purposes through clever design rather than brute-force complexity. This approach yields efficient use of resources while maintaining clarity and serviceability. 

The platform embraces Pragmatic Modernization, incorporating contemporary interfaces and manufacturing techniques in ways that preserve the system's accessibility and educational value. This careful integration of modern elements enhances rather than obscures the fundamental simplicity of the design.

Flexible Evolution stands as another cornerstone of the architecture. The system accommodates various processor and memory configurations while maintaining a consistent programming model, allowing it to grow with user needs without compromising its core principles.

The following sections detail how these principles manifest in specific aspects of the system architecture, from processor selection to memory management and I/O subsystems.

== System Architecture
The Aves platform's architectural heritage stems from the remarkable family of Commodore 8-bit and 16-bit computers, drawing particular inspiration from the CBM8096, Commodore 64 and Plus/4 machines. Whilst these classic designs laid the groundwork, Aves refines and modernises their most successful elements into a cohesive and elegant architecture.

At the heart of every Aves system lies a philosophy of considered minimalism, where each component serves multiple purposes through clever design rather than brute-force complexity. This approach manifests most notably in the memory management and I/O subsystems, where time-tested concepts from the Commodore machines have been thoughtfully reimagined.

The memory architecture pays homage to the innovative bank-switching schemes of its forebears. Where the CBM8096 introduced upper memory banking, and the Commodore 64 demonstrated the flexibility of ROM overlay techniques, Aves unifies these concepts into a sophisticated yet straightforward memory management system. This arrangement provides remarkable flexibility whilst maintaining compatibility with traditional software design patterns.

Perhaps the most significant departure from tradition lies in the I/O subsystem. Where Commodore machines typically employed multiple interface adapters—CIAs, PIAs, and various custom chips—Aves consolidates these functions into a carefully orchestrated arrangement centred on the W65C22 VIA. This consolidation does not represent a compromise but rather an elegant solution that reduces complexity whilst expanding capabilities.

The VIA implementation demonstrates the platform's pragmatic approach to modernisation. Through thoughtful programming of this versatile chip, Aves achieves compatibility with contemporary interfaces such as I2C and SPI, whilst also supporting a custom high-speed serial protocol, the Aves Serial Bus (ASB). This bus draws inspiration from the efficiency of Commodore's serial bus architecture whilst eliminating its notorious timing dependencies.

Throughout the system, one finds this pattern of respectful modernisation. The hardware banking mechanisms, whilst more sophisticated than their predecessors, maintain familiar programming paradigms. The interrupt handling system, though more capable than the original Commodore implementations, remains straightforward and predictable. Even the most advanced configurations, supporting the 16-bit W65816 processor, retain compatibility with their 8-bit siblings through carefully considered hardware abstractions.

This architectural philosophy extends to the physical design as well. The circuit board layouts, component selection, and signal routing all reflect a balance between simplicity and capability. Modern manufacturing techniques and components are employed where beneficial, yet the system remains accessible to hobbyist construction and modification, maintaining the spirit of its predecessors.

==== I2C Interface
The I2C interface is implemented in software using PA0 of the VIA for SCL and PA7 for SDA. This arrangement provides optimal bit manipulation capabilities, as testing bit 7 with the BIT instruction will directly affect the processor's N flag for efficient state testing. Both lines require external 4.7kΩ pull-up resistors to VCC to ensure proper signal levels and to meet I2C bus specifications.

The implementation leverages specific characteristics of the 65C02 instruction set. The lines are manipulated using the data direction register to create a pseudo open-drain configuration - setting a pin as input allows it to float high via the pull-up resistor, while setting it as output drives it low. Start conditions are generated by transitioning SDA from high to low while SCL is high, with stop conditions created by the opposite transition. Clock generation employs increment and decrement instructions for precise timing control, while the BIT instruction enables rapid testing of PA7's state through the N flag.

The interface supports standard mode I2C operation at 100 kHz, with timing managed through software delays calibrated to the system clock frequency. Clock stretching is supported through continuous monitoring of the SCL line state, allowing compatibility with slower I2C peripheral devices. Multi-master mode is not supported.

==== SPI Interface
The SPI interface is implemented in firmware, as modes 0 and 3 only. As with the I2C interface the clock; SCK is implemented on PB0, PB1-PB3 contains the device number and is decoded with a 74HC138 decoder to provide 7 device selects ss1-ss7.

MOSI uses PB6 and MISO PB7. 

SPI is output at 5V with inputs at TTL levels SPI memory and IO devices.

==== Aves Serial Bus (ASB)
The Aves serial bus uses the VIA shift register to implement a half duplex serial protocol, that is substantially faster than Commodore's propitiatory Serial bus (frequently incorrectly referred to as IEC). The VIA's CAn lines are used as handshake lines. PA6 is used to determine if the bus is transmitting or receiving

==== PS/2 Keyboard Interface
The PS/2 Keyboard interface is based on Ben Eater's PS/2 keyboard interface design, which uses 74HC595 shift registers. Unlike Ben's implementation, data is read directly from the register's parallel output, freeing up 8 additional I/O lines on the VIA. The interrupt logic remains unchanged, using the VIA's CA1 input to detect incoming data.

==== I/O expansion port 
The I/O expansion port is presented on a 34 pin right angle male header, it comprises the 8 x data lines, 12 x address lines, 4 x select lines, RnW, Phi2, RESETb, IRQb, power and gnd.
