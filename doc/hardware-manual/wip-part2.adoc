== Processor Architecture
=== Primary CPU Options
=== Processor Options
Aves offers a choice of 8 and 16-bit CPUs within a common architecture. The platform's I/O operations are handled by an 8-bit CPU to maximise Kernel code reuse and simplify multi-architecture support. All CPUs are CMOS variants for reduced power consumption.

The 6502's minimal register set and zero-page usage as pseudo registers provides excellent interrupt latency. When paired with support chips like the 6522 Versatile Interface Adapter (VIA), this makes it an ideal choice for I/O handling.

In dual processor configurations, a R65C02 running at 4MHz serves as the I/O co-processor, working alongside primary CPUs such as the V25/V35, Z16C00, or MC68HC000. Communication between processors occurs through dual port memory, creating a loosely coupled architecture that simplifies inter-CPU communication and allows each processor to run at its optimal clock speed.

|CPU|Description

|R65C02
|The Rockwell R65C02 is no longer in production, but is widely available as new old stock. It is used in several Aves models and  is always clocked at 4MHz. The R65C02 is pin compatible with the original MOS 6502, which was fabricated in NMOS. One of many advantages the 65C02 has over its NMOS sibling is an enhanced instruction set

|W65C02
|The Western Design Center W65C02 is currently in production. WDC were the creators of the CPU core used in the R65C02, and the W65C02 is later version of this core. The same instruction set is used but the CPU it can be run at 14MHz, is fully static and can has tri-state address and data bus lines. A new WAI instruction stops the CPU clock and reduces power to a minimum, it will restart when an interrupt occurs

|W65816
|The Western design center W65816 is a 16-bit variant of the W65C02 with an 8-bit emulation mode as well as 24 bit segmented address bus. The W65C816 has a maximum clock speed of 14MHz

|NEC V25 and V35
|The NEC (now Renesas) V25 and V35 are CMOS variants of the Intel 8088 and 8086 respectively, with integrated UARTs, Timers, GPIO and DMA. The V25 has an 8-bit data bus and the V35 has a 16-bit bus both have a 20 bit address bus. which uses the same segmented strategy used by Intel

|MC68HC000
|The Motorola MC68HC000 highly successful and well regarded CPU, was used to power the Commodore Amiga and Atari ST computers. Its architecture and performance were a breakthrough, and this CPU is adopted to pay homage to such an innovation. 

The MC68HC000 had a 32 bit addressing capability with 24 bit address bus width. It has a maximum clock speed of 10MHz, and has a dual mode CPU bus timing that supports older 6800 and 6500 8-bit peripherals, as well as an updated asynchronous native bus. 

|Z16C00
|The Z16C01 is a CMOS version of the Zilog Z8001 CPU, and is included as a curiosity and acknowledgment of the Commodore C900 Zilog Z8001 based "UNIX machine" prototype. The Z8001 was another 16-bit CPU that was developed at around the same time as the Intel 8086 and Motorola 68000. The Z8001 used a 24 bit segmented architecture, although only 23 bits where available on the address bus. The Z16C01 has a maximum clock frequency of 10MHz

=== Memory Architecture
The elegant simplicity of the Aves architecture finds perhaps its clearest expression in its memory management system. Here, the platform's philosophy of considered minimalism meets the practical demands of modern computing, resulting in a memory architecture that is both powerful and approachable. Drawing upon decades of experience with 6502-family systems, this design accommodates everything from simple linear arrangements to sophisticated banking schemes, all whilst maintaining a consistent programming model.

=== I/O Ports
All Aves models support the same set of I/O ports of two industry standard serial ports, a custom shift register based serial bus and a parallel memory mapped I/O expansion bus. All of the serial interfaces are implemented on a single W65C22.

==== I/O Memory Map 
I/O is directly mapped into the processors 64K memory map, the Aves architecture reserves the top 256 bytes of the address space (0xFF00-0xFFFF) for reset vectors, interrupt handing, and bank switching. the next 256 bytes (0xFE00-0xFEFF) is reserved for I/O devices

The next two 256 bytes areas between  0xFC00-0xDFF can also be enabled for I/O access using bits 6 and 5 in the MCR. 

The area from 0xE000-0xEFFF can also be reserved for dual port memory, and is selected using bit 5 of the MCR
