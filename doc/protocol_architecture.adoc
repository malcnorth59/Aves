=== Device States and Initialization

==== Initial State
* All responders start in offline state
* Devices remain offline until ATN/ACK completed
* No bus activity from responders until initialized

==== Initialization Process
1. Controller sends ATN
2. Device responds with ACK
3. Only after successful ATN/ACK:
   * Device becomes active on bus
   * Device can respond to addressed commands

==== Reset Sequence
* Returns devices to offline state
* No handshaking required
* No acknowledgment needed
* Requires new ATN/ACK to become active again

This enforces a clean initialization sequence - devices must explicitly join the bus through ATN/ACK before participating in any transactions. Would you like me to expand on any aspect of this initialization process?

=== Responder Device States
The responder device follows a simple but robust state machine model that ensures reliable communication on the ASB bus.

==== State Descriptions

===== IDLE State
* Default power-on state
* Device is offline and not participating in bus transactions
* Monitors bus for ATN signal
* Must complete ATN/ACK handshake before responding to any commands
* Only transitions from IDLE after:
  1. Detecting ATN signal
  2. Completing ATN/ACK handshake
  3. Receiving command with matching address

===== TALKING State
* Device is online and transmitting data
* Entered from IDLE after successful handshake and address match
* Maintains control of bus until transmission complete
* Returns to IDLE after completion

===== LISTENING State
* Device is online and receiving data
* Entered from IDLE after successful handshake and address match
* Monitors incoming data until transaction complete
* Returns to IDLE after completion

=== Controller Device States
The controller implements a four-state machine model that manages bus operations and data flow. This design ensures orderly transitions between sending commands, transmitting data, and receiving responses.

==== State Descriptions
* IDLE
** Default bus state
** Ready to initiate commands
** No active transfers

* TALKING
** Controller is sending data
** Maintains state for multiple sends
** Returns to IDLE via UNTALK

* TURNAROUND
** Transitional state between IDLE and LISTENING
** Preparing bus for receive operation
** Transitions to LISTENING when ready

* LISTENING
** Controller receiving data
** Can receive multiple data bytes
** Returns to IDLE via UNLISTEN

==== Transition Rules
* All transfers start from IDLE
* TURNAROUND required before LISTENING
* Self-loops on TALKING/LISTENING for data transfer
* Clean return to IDLE via UNTALK/UNLISTEN

==== Bus Turnaround Management

===== Overview
* Controlled transition between bus directions
* Required for bidirectional communication
* Managed by controller device

===== Timing Requirements
* 100µs minimum turnaround delay
  - Ensures signal settling
  - Allows device preparation
  - Prevents bus contention

* Signal Requirements
  - All signals must return to idle state
  - Data lines must float during transition
  - ATN must remain stable during turnaround

===== Control Sequence
1. Current talker releases bus
2. Controller initiates turnaround
3. Minimum delay period observed
4. New talker takes control

===== State Transitions
* IDLE → TURNAROUND
  - Controller prepares for direction change
  - All devices observe bus release
* TURNAROUND → LISTENING
  - After minimum delay period
  - When new talker ready

===== Implementation Requirements
* Controller Responsibilities
  - Manage turnaround timing
  - Monitor bus state
  - Enforce minimum delays

* Responder Behavior
  - Release bus when instructed
  - Wait for complete turnaround
  - Monitor for new commands

===== Error Handling
* Timeout Detection
  - 100µs maximum for device response
  - Return to IDLE on violation
* Bus Contention
  - Detected by controller
  - Forces reset on violation
