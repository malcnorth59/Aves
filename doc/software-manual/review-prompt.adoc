== Documentation Structure Guidelines
The Kingfisher documentation format follows a structured approach with specific sections and formatting requirements.

=== Opening Section
The document begins with an introduction and smoothly transitions to the main subject matter, written in a narrative style.

Constructor documentation follows on directly after the opening section using a two-column table format, sorted alphabetically by Constructor with a bold title as shown below. 

All narrative should be kept ahead of the tables and examples, the exception being the use of [NOTE] if required after a table or code.

==== Multiple Tables and Examples
In some circumstances additional subheadings are required, but this should follow the same patterm with no lower than a level 4 heading. that is a section heading with narrative followed byt table(s) and examples.

.Constructor Definitions

|Constructor|Description

|Constructor name with stack signature

Methods and definition follow on directly from constructors using a similar style to constructors.

.Available Methods
[%header, cols="2,3"]

|Operation|Description

|Operation name with stack signature
|Detailed explanation

|===

Code examples follow on from available operations in bold titles, unbreakable source code blocks. Examples should be the last item in section.

=== Section Hierarchy
Section headings should follow these levels:
* Level 1: =
* Level 2: ==
* Level 3: ===
* Level 4: ====
* Beyond level 4: Use titles

=== Writing Style
The documentation should:

* Use British English spelling and conventions. Continue to use program rather than programme in the context of computer software
* Employ narrative form rather than bullet points where possible
* Avoid short, colon-terminated sentences
* Maintain a professional and comprehensive tone throughout
