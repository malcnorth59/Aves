== Storage device mapping
Kingfisher supports three types of storage device, each with their own type of file system. An abstraction layer provides a common interface to all three device types. 

=== Control Byte States
[%header,cols="1,3"]
|===
|Device Type|Description

|SC1-2
|SD Cards 
(direct mapping to SPI chip select lines)

|SD1-8
| Commodore devices (with secondary addressing 0,1 for load/save, 2-14 dynamic, 15 for commands)

|SE1-8
|Serial EEPROM devices (128KB each, hardware-linked I2C addresses)

== EEPROM File System Design

=== Directory Structure
* Block 0 contains directory entries
* Each entry is 18 bytes:
** +0: Control byte (status)
** +1: 16 byte filename
** +17: Start block pointer

|===
|Value |Description
|0xFF |Free (virgin) entry
|0x7F |Active file
|0x3F |Deleted (recoverable)
|0x1F |Reallocated entry
|===

=== Directory Allocation Strategy
* Scan directory entries (20 byte boundaries)
* Track first occurrence of:
** 0xFF (free entry)
** 0x1F (reusable entry)
** 0x3F (deleted entry)
* Allocation priority:
. Try 0xFF entry with block allocation
. If no blocks, reclaim 0x3F chain and convert to 0x1F
. Reuse existing 0x1F entry

=== File Structure
* Files stored as sequence of counted strings
* Each string:
** Count byte
** String data
* End of file detected by two consecutive 0xFF bytes
* 0xFF can appear in data (check next byte)

=== Block Operations
* Format: Reset all blocks to 0xFF
* Directory entry reclamation: 
** Erase 18 bytes individually back to 0xFF
* Undelete:
** Possible for 0x3F entries if chain intact
** Convert control byte 0x3F -> 0x7F

=== Example File Format
[source]
----
[05][Hello][05][World][01][!][FF][FF]...
 ^     ^     ^     ^     ^     ^
 count data  count data  count EOF
----

=== Reading Algorithm
[source]
----
While true
    count = ReadByte()
    If count == 0xFF
        next = ReadByte()
        If next == 0xFF
            // End of file
            break
        Else
            // Valid count
            Seek(-1)
        End
    End
    ReadBytes(count)
End

=== Key Benefits
* Minimal EEPROM wear
* Natural append operations
* No size tracking needed
* Simple undelete support
* Efficient space usage
* Self-describing format

SD Card File System Summary

DIRECTORY STRUCTURE
Block 0: Directory entries (32 bytes each)
  +0:  Control byte (status)
      0xFF = Free (virgin) entry
      0x7F = Active file
      0x3F = Deleted (recoverable)
      0x1F = Reallocated entry
  +1:  Filename (29 bytes)
  +30: Start cluster (16-bit)

FILE STRUCTURE
- Files stored as sequence of counted strings
- Each string: [count byte][data bytes]
- End marked by two 0xFF bytes
- 0xFF in data handled by checking next byte
- Clusters chained with 16-bit pointers
- 0xFFFF marks end of chain

OPERATIONS
- Block reads/writes (no seek needed)
- 4KB buffer with block pointer navigation
- Directory scans using block operations
- Simple append operations
- Basic undelete support
- Size calculation by walking chain

BENEFITS
- Minimal card wear 
- Natural sequential access
- No file size tracking needed
- Simple implementation
- Efficient space usage
- Self-describing format
