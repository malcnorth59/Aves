= Assembly Language and System Fundamentals
This section covers the internal structures and mechanisms used by Kingfisher for managing system types, variables, and memory. It includes details about dictionary structures, system variables, primitives, and assembly language support.

== Assembly Language
While system primitives provide low-level access to system state, assembly language support enables direct hardware control and optimisation. Assembly source code in Kingfisher integrates seamlessly with high-level constructs while maintaining safety constraints.

=== Design Philosophy
Kingfisher's assembly language implementation is guided by several core principles that align with the overall language design. The core principles of safety and correctness are paramount, it is essential that while assembly language provides direct hardware access Kingfisher's safety guarantees are maintained without introducing additional complexity. This is achieved through compile time verification of memory access, type checking of operands, and enforcement of system protection boundaries wherever possible.

Explicit intent is another key principle. Unlike traditional assemblers that infer addressing modes from operand syntax, Kingfisher requires explicit specification of addressing modes. While this creates slightly more verbose code, it eliminates ambiguity and potential errors.

.Traditional vs Explicit Addressing Example
[source]
----
 ; Traditional assembly - mode inferred from syntax
  LDA #42      ; Immediate mode
  LDA $1000    ; Absolute mode
  
// Kingfisher - explicit addressing modes
  lda imm 42            // Immediate mode
  lda abs 0x1000        // Absolute mode
----
--

Integration with high-level language features is another fundamental aspect of the design. Assembly source code exists within the scope of code blocks which are similar to Kingfisher's Defs or methods, allowing seamless interaction with Kingfisher's type system, memory management, and error handling mechanisms. This integration extends to the expression system, which allows assembly operands to include full expressions that are evaluated at compile time. Expressions are enclosed in square brackets [ ] and can include arithmetic operations, constants, and macro expansions. 

The `#` operator is used to extract individual bytes from multi-byte values, and `@` is used to calculate the position of high and low bytes in memory. The `#` operand must be in the range 0 to 3 where 0 returns the low order byte and 3 the high order byte. This approach makes it very easy to work with addresses and works consistently regardless of byte-order.

Assembly language maintains consistency with Kingfisher's broader syntax conventions, which includes using `//` for comments, requiring explicit block structure, and following similar naming conventions. This consistency reduces cognitive overhead when moving between high-level and assembly source code.

// Compile-time expression evaluation in operands
  lda imm   0 # ptr      // High byte of ptr address
  sta zp    0 @ ptr      // Store in ptr
  lda imm   1 # ptr      // High byte of ptr address                 
  sta zp    1 # ptr      // Store in ptr+1

=== Assembly Language Core
The core assembly language features begin with label definitions, which provide a way to name constants and addresses for use in assembly source code. Labels can be defined using literal values or expressions and serve as symbolic references throughout the enclosing Code or Method block. These labels form the foundation for writing readable and maintainable assembly source code by providing meaningful names for values and locations in memory.

|( Num : ) Label name
|Define a constant label that can be used in operands. Labels are only used during the assembly process and do not occupy memory at runtime

    // Define constant labels
    0xFF Label minus-one        // Define constant -1
    0x1000 Label screen         // Screen memory location
    [ 40 50 + ] Label width     // Can use arithmetic in definition
    
    // Demonstrate label usage in code
    lda imm minus-one           // Load 0xFF
    sta abs screen              // Store to $1000
    
    // Demonstrate expressions with labels
    lda abs [ screen width + ]  // Calculate address
    
    // Demonstrate address labels
start:                          // Address label
    lda imm 0                   // Load zero
    beq start                   // Branch to start
End Method

=== Instruction Set Support
Instruction Set Support provides comprehensive access to the complete 65xx instruction set through Kingfisher-specific syntax adaptations. The system accommodates both standard 6502 and enhanced 65C02 instructions, ensuring full compatibility across the processor family. 

The design principles and syntax conventions established here are intended to extend beyond the 65xx family. Future versions of the assembler will support other classic CPU architectures including the Intel 8086, Motorola 68000, and Zilog Z8000 processor families. This extensible approach ensures consistent syntax and programming patterns across different instruction sets while maintaining the explicit addressing modes and safety guarantees that are central to Kingfisher's design.

=== Assembler
The assembler in Kingfisher provides a structured framework for creating executable 
machine code by extending the capabilities of the compiler. The assembly process uses the interpreter to find opcodes and directives in the dictionary and the executes them to compile them into the source, in much the same way as higher level source is compiled. This ability enables switching between compiler and assembler easily, allowing for integration and access to Kingfisher's vocabulary.

There are two mechanisms to access assembly language. The first is the ability to create a code definition in similar way to `Def`. The second is to enable assembly in a linked method.

=== ((Macro Processing))
Macro processors can be used in compilers or assemblers to abbreviates language syntax, and makes it easier to repeat complex construct consistently. Macros can also have parameters enabling programmers to create syntactic patterns that can be reused in different contexts.

The Kingfisher macro processor is integrated into the compiler and assembler enabling programmers to use macros in either system.

== System Data Structures
Additional controls are required to manage system variables, which includes more constructors and methods to give the variable a fixed address, and to enable creation of singletons.

Singletons are declared using `Static` which uses a similar syntax to 'Type'. Unlike standard types, static types are constructed when they are defined, which limits the number of instances to one. A static instance is accessed using linked methods just like any other type.

All data structures support the `Locate` method which removes a variable from the heap and locates it at a specific location. 

The `Register` word is used to mark the variable as a system register and the word is allocated a position in the system register space. If locate is used with a register the address must be within the system register address space.

((Locate)) and ((Register)) words must immediately follow a constructor or static definition to avoid memory fragmentation. 

.System Data Constructors
[%header, cols="2,3"]
|===
|Constructor|Description

|( : ) Static name
|Creates a new static type

|===

.System Data Words
[%header, cols="2,3"]
|===
|Operations|Description

|( Var : ) Locate name
|The locate method must be used immediately after variable creation and before any other defining words are used. The named variable is moved from the heap and located at the specified address

|( : ) Register name
|The register method must be used immediately after variable creation and before any other defining words are used. The named variable is moved from the heap into the system register page.

|===

==== Static Type Definitions
Static types in Kingfisher are defined using a structured template syntax that enables precise control over memory layout and field access. The static definition begins with a stack signature followed by the 'Static' keyword and a list of field definitions, terminated with End. For a detailed description of type methods, and constructors see <<Type Definitions>>.

0x010 Locate chain  // ... fix them at 0x010


// Example type with auto-increment addressing
( : ) chain Method Activate

End

[IMPORTANT]
====
Static types trade flexibility for efficiency by allocating memory at compile time
and eliminating constructor overhead. Regular types provide instance isolation but
require runtime construction.

== Interrupts
Interrupt handling in Kingfisher provides a mechanism for responding to external events in a timely and efficient. While powerful, it's crucial to use interrupts carefully to avoid performance degradation and system instability.

=== Interrupt Handling System
The Kingfisher interrupt handling system comprises three key components, as shown in the following table.

[cols="2,3"]
|===

|System Interrupt Handler
|The core mechanism that receives and interrupts from the CPU.

|Interrupt Prioritisation
|A system for assigning priorities to different interrupt sources, ensuring that critical events are handled promptly. Interrupt prioritisation ensures that higher priority interrupts are handled before lower priority interrupts, preventing critical events from being delayed.

|Interrupt Service Routines
|User-defined functions that are executed in response to specific interrupts. For example an ISR might handle a timer interrupt by updating a system clock, or a keyboard interrupt by reading keypresses from the input buffer.

|===

==== Interrupt Processing
Interrupt processing leverages the CPUs built-in interrupt mechanism. When an interrupt occurs, the actions listed in the following table are performed.

[cols="2,3"]
|===

|Interrupt Acknowledgement
|The CPU signals an interrupt to the Kingfisher system, which responds to the interrupt at the end of the current CPU instruction and the CPU registers are saved on the system stack.

|Customer Increment
|The system interrupt handler increments an internal counter. The CPU registers are restored and execution continues.

|Deferred Handling
|The actual processing of interrupts is deferred until the end of the current definition.

The deferred approach minimises the need for extensive state preservation within the interrupt handler itself. By relying on the existing stack-based parameter passing mechanism of Kingfisher, the overhead of handling interrupts is kept to a minimum. 

The inner interpreter checks the interrupt counter at the end of each definition (next), and calls the interrupt processing routine only when the counter is greater than zero.

|Interrupt Processing
|The system proceeds to execute the appropriate interrupt service routines based on their priorities.

|Counter Decrement
|The interrupt counter decrements following completion of the interrupt processing routine. This mechanism ensures that interrupts are handled efficiently while minimising disruptions to the normal flow of program execution.

|===

[NOTE]
This approach relies on the interrupt frequency being lower than the overall interrupt handling period. It is the responsibility of the programmer to ensure the interrupt frequency and handling period do not impact the performance of the application.

==== Interrupt Management
Interrupts are managed using a singleton object called `isr`. The following tables lists all the methods linked with the `isr` object.

.ISR Methods
|===
|Operations|Descriptions

|( Byte : ) AddHandler name
|The word specified by name is added to the specified interrupt priority as the ISR

|( Byte : ) Disable
|Disable interrupts at teh specified priority level only. Priority 0 is all interrupts, while 1-4 are individual interrupt priorities with 1 being the highest and 4 lowest

|( Enable : ) Enable
|Enable interrupts at the specified priority level only

|===

4 Constant irq-p1   // Lowest Priority

// Word to count 100 x 10mS events
// Counter will roll over every 1 second
( : ) Def Count
    counter.get 100 =
    If
        counter.Reset
    Else
        1 counter.Add
    End
End

// Initialis counters and interrupts
( : ) Def InitCounter
    // Disable all interrupts before initialisation
    irq-p4 isr.Disable

    // Reset the counter to zero
    counter.Reset

    // Initialise timer device to 10mS

    // Add the Count word as the priority 4 interrupt handler
    irq-p4 isr.Addhandler Count

    // Enable priority 4 interrupts
    irq-p4 isr.Enable
