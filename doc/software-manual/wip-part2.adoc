=== Dictionary System
The dictionary system is the core mechanism for managing definitions in Kingfisher. It provides word lookup, definition storage, and type checking through a chain-based vocabulary system.

==== Vocabularies and Chains
Vocabularies are collections of related word definitions managed as units. The system uses four distinct chains to control word visibility and lookup:

.Vocabulary Chains
[%header, cols="1,3"]
|===
|Chain|Description
|Active|Main scope for active vocabularies, used for searching and adding definitions
|Extended|Searched before Active scope, lookup only (no new definitions)
|Restricted|Limits word lookup to specific vocabulary
|Excluded|Contains unused vocabularies removed from other chains
