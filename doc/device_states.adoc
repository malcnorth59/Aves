=== Controller Device States
The controller implements a four-state machine model that manages bus operations and data flow. This design ensures orderly transitions between sending commands, transmitting data, and receiving responses.

==== State Descriptions
* IDLE
** Default bus state
** Ready to initiate commands
** No active transfers

* TALKING
** Controller is sending data
** Maintains state for multiple sends
** Returns to IDLE via UNTALK

* TURNAROUND
** Transitional state between IDLE and LISTENING
** Preparing bus for receive operation
** Transitions to LISTENING when ready

* LISTENING
** Controller receiving data
** Can receive multiple data bytes
** Returns to IDLE via UNLISTEN

==== Transition Rules
* All transfers start from IDLE
* TURNAROUND required before LISTENING
* Self-loops on TALKING/LISTENING for data transfer
* Clean return to IDLE via UNTALK/UNLISTEN

=== Responder Device States
The responder device follows a simple but robust state machine model that ensures reliable communication on the ASB bus.

==== State Descriptions

===== IDLE State
* Default power-on state
* Device is offline and not participating in bus transactions
* Monitors bus for ATN signal
* Must complete ATN/ACK handshake before responding to any commands
* Only transitions from IDLE after:
  1. Detecting ATN signal
  2. Completing ATN/ACK handshake
  3. Receiving command with matching address

===== TALKING State
* Device is online and transmitting data
* Entered from IDLE after successful handshake and address match
* Maintains control of bus until transmission complete
* Returns to IDLE after completion

===== LISTENING State
* Device is online and receiving data
* Entered from IDLE after successful handshake and address match
* Monitors incoming data until transaction complete
* Returns to IDLE after completion
