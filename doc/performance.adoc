=== Protocol Performance Comparison

==== Commodore Serial (IEC)
* Clock rate: ~1 bit/ms typical
* Byte transfer: ~8-10ms per byte
* Effective transfer rate: ~100-125 bytes/second
* Limited by software bit-banging and long settling times

==== ASB Protocol
* Timeout boundary: 100µs per handshake
* Minimum theoretical throughput: ~5KB/second
* Practical transfer rates: 
** ~2-3KB/second typical
** Up to 10KB/second possible with optimized code
* Hardware-assisted handshaking via VIA
* 20-30x faster than Commodore serial typical case

==== Key Differences
* ASB uses hardware handshaking vs IEC software timing
* ASB transfers full bytes vs IEC bit-by-bit transfer
* ASB timeout is worst-case vs IEC being typical case
* ASB self-paces to device capabilities vs IEC fixed timing
* Both protocols support multiple devices but ASB allows higher device count (15 vs 8)

=== Bus Turnaround

==== Timing Characteristics
* Self-pacing through handshake acknowledgment
* No fixed timing requirement
* 100µs timeout as worst-case boundary
* Actual speed determined by device capabilities

==== Turnaround Sequence
1. Controller initiates turnaround
2. Waits for device acknowledgment
3. Device signals ready state
4. Transfer proceeds at negotiated pace

==== Implementation Benefits
* Natural speed matching between devices
* No artificial delays required
* Robust operation across different device speeds
* Consistent with overall protocol philosophy
* Same timeout boundary as other operations (100µs)

==== Performance Considerations
* Turnaround overhead minimized through self-pacing
* No need for fixed delay loops
* System automatically finds optimal timing
* Reliable operation without performance penalty
