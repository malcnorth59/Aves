== Abstract
The Aves hardware platform represents a flexible and extensible 8/16-bit computer architecture designed to bridge classic computing with modern interfaces and capabilities. Named after the taxonomic class of birds, Aves embodies both elegance and adaptability in its design.

This system supports multiple processor configurations, from the classic R65C02 to the more advanced W65816, with options for dual-processor arrangements incorporating the V25, V35, Z8K and MC68K. The architecture accommodates various memory configurations, from simple linear addressing to sophisticated bank-switched and segmented memory layouts, providing up to 2MB of addressable space.

At its core, Aves combines the simplicity and reliability of 8-bit systems with some of the expandability of contemporary systems. The platform features a versatile I/O subsystem built around the W65C22 VIA, supporting multiple communication protocols including I2C, SPI, and the custom Aves Serial Bus (ASB).

This hardware reference manual provides comprehensive documentation of the Aves system architecture, memory configurations, bus arrangements, and interface specifications. It serves as the authoritative reference for hardware developers, system programmers, and enthusiasts working with the Aves platform.

== Foreword
The Aves hardware platform represents a thoughtful convergence of classic computing heritage and modern design principles. This project emerged from a deep appreciation for the elegant architectures of early microcomputers, particularly those from Commodore, while embracing contemporary interface standards and manufacturing techniques.

In developing Aves, the preservation of the accessibility and educational value that made 8-bit systems so remarkable, was the highest priority. The result is not merely a recreation of vintage hardware, but rather a carefully considered evolution that maintains the spirit of its predecessors while offering new possibilities.

This reference manual documents the technical implementation of these goals. Whether you're a hardware developer integrating Aves into a larger system, a programmer writing software for the platform, or an enthusiast exploring computer architecture, you'll find detailed information about the system's capabilities and design principles.

The manual is structured to serve both as a comprehensive reference and as an educational resource. While some sections delve into complex technical details, there is a focus on clarity and practical application throughout. The included examples and explanations aim to make the material accessible without sacrificing technical accuracy.

We hope this documentation helps you understand and utilise the full potential of the Aves platform, whether you're building, programming, or simply exploring this bridge between classic and contemporary computing.

== Architectural Principles
Before delving into specific technical details, it's important to understand the fundamental design philosophies and architectural decisions that shape the Aves platform. These principles reflect both practical engineering considerations and broader goals for the system's role in modern retrocomputing.

The architecture of Aves represents a careful balance between preserving the elegant simplicity of classic 8-bit systems and incorporating modern design practices. Rather than simply replicating vintage hardware, each aspect of the system has been thoughtfully evaluated and, where appropriate, enhanced to meet contemporary needs while maintaining the spirit of its inspiration.

At the heart of Aves lies Considered Minimalism, where each component serves multiple purposes through clever design rather than brute-force complexity. This approach yields efficient use of resources while maintaining clarity and serviceability. 

The platform embraces Pragmatic Modernization, incorporating contemporary interfaces and manufacturing techniques in ways that preserve the system's accessibility and educational value. This careful integration of modern elements enhances rather than obscures the fundamental simplicity of the design.

Flexible Evolution stands as another cornerstone of the architecture. The system accommodates various processor and memory configurations while maintaining a consistent programming model, allowing it to grow with user needs without compromising its core principles.

The following sections detail how these principles manifest in specific aspects of the system architecture, from processor selection to memory management and I/O subsystems.

== System Architecture
The Aves platform's architectural heritage stems from the remarkable family of Commodore 8-bit and 16-bit computers, drawing particular inspiration from the CBM8096, Commodore 64 and Plus/4 machines. Whilst these classic designs laid the groundwork, Aves refines and modernises their most successful elements into a cohesive and elegant architecture.

At the heart of every Aves system lies a philosophy of considered minimalism, where each component serves multiple purposes through clever design rather than brute-force complexity. This approach manifests most notably in the memory management and I/O subsystems, where time-tested concepts from the Commodore machines have been thoughtfully reimagined.

The memory architecture pays homage to the innovative bank-switching schemes of its forebears. Where the CBM8096 introduced upper memory banking, and the Commodore 64 demonstrated the flexibility of ROM overlay techniques, Aves unifies these concepts into a sophisticated yet straightforward memory management system. This arrangement provides remarkable flexibility whilst maintaining compatibility with traditional software design patterns.

Perhaps the most significant departure from tradition lies in the I/O subsystem. Where Commodore machines typically employed multiple interface adapters—CIAs, PIAs, and various custom chips—Aves consolidates these functions into a carefully orchestrated arrangement centred on the W65C22 VIA. This consolidation does not represent a compromise but rather an elegant solution that reduces complexity whilst expanding capabilities.

The VIA implementation demonstrates the platform's pragmatic approach to modernisation. Through thoughtful programming of this versatile chip, Aves achieves compatibility with contemporary interfaces such as I2C and SPI, whilst also supporting a custom high-speed serial protocol, the Aves Serial Bus (ASB). This bus draws inspiration from the efficiency of Commodore's serial bus architecture whilst eliminating its notorious timing dependencies.

Throughout the system, one finds this pattern of respectful modernisation. The hardware banking mechanisms, whilst more sophisticated than their predecessors, maintain familiar programming paradigms. The interrupt handling system, though more capable than the original Commodore implementations, remains straightforward and predictable. Even the most advanced configurations, supporting the 16-bit W65816 processor, retain compatibility with their 8-bit siblings through carefully considered hardware abstractions.

This architectural philosophy extends to the physical design as well. The circuit board layouts, component selection, and signal routing all reflect a balance between simplicity and capability. Modern manufacturing techniques and components are employed where beneficial, yet the system remains accessible to hobbyist construction and modification, maintaining the spirit of its predecessors.

=== Processor Options
Aves offers a choice of 8 and 16-bit CPUs within a common architecture. The platform's I/O operations are handled by an 8-bit CPU to maximise Kernel code reuse and simplify multi-architecture support. All CPUs are CMOS variants for reduced power consumption.

The 6502's minimal register set and zero-page usage as pseudo registers provides excellent interrupt latency. When paired with support chips like the 6522 Versatile Interface Adapter (VIA), this makes it an ideal choice for I/O handling.

In dual processor configurations, a R65C02 running at 4MHz serves as the I/O co-processor, working alongside primary CPUs such as the V25/V35, Z16C00, or MC68HC000. Communication between processors occurs through dual port memory, creating a loosely coupled architecture that simplifies inter-CPU communication and allows each processor to run at its optimal clock speed.

.Supported CPU Types
[%header, cols="2,3"]
|===
|CPU|Description

|R65C02
|The Rockwell R65C02 is no longer in production, but is widely available as new old stock. It is used in several Aves models and  is always clocked at 4MHz. The R65C02 is pin compatible with the original MOS 6502, which was fabricated in NMOS. One of many advantages the 65C02 has over its NMOS sibling is an enhanced instruction set

|W65C02
|The Western Design Center W65C02 is currently in production. WDC were the creators of the CPU core used in the R65C02, and the W65C02 is later version of this core. The same instruction set is used but the CPU it can be run at 14MHz, is fully static and can has tri-state address and data bus lines. A new WAI instruction stops the CPU clock and reduces power to a minimum, it will restart when an interrupt occurs

|W65816
|The Western design center W65816 is a 16-bit variant of the W65C02 with an 8-bit emulation mode as well as 24 bit segmented address bus. The W65C816 has a maximum clock speed of 14MHz

|NEC V25 and V35
|The NEC (now Renesas) V25 and V35 are CMOS variants of the Intel 8088 and 8086 respectively, with integrated UARTs, Timers, GPIO and DMA. The V25 has an 8-bit data bus and the V35 has a 16-bit bus both have a 20 bit address bus. which uses the same segmented strategy used by Intel

|MC68HC000
|The Motorola MC68HC000 highly successful and well regarded CPU, was used to power the Commodore Amiga and Atari ST computers. Its architecture and performance were a breakthrough, and this CPU is adopted to pay homage to such an innovation. 

The MC68HC000 had a 32 bit addressing capability with 24 bit address bus width. It has a maximum clock speed of 10MHz, and has a dual mode CPU bus timing that supports older 6800 and 6500 8-bit peripherals, as well as an updated asynchronous native bus. 

|Z16C00
|The Z16C01 is a CMOS version of the Zilog Z8001 CPU, and is included as a curiosity and acknowledgment of the Commodore C900 Zilog Z8001 based "UNIX machine" prototype. The Z8001 was another 16-bit CPU that was developed at around the same time as the Intel 8086 and Motorola 68000. The Z8001 used a 24 bit segmented architecture, although only 23 bits where available on the address bus. The Z16C01 has a maximum clock frequency of 10MHz

=== Memory Architecture
The elegant simplicity of the Aves architecture finds perhaps its clearest expression in its memory management system. Here, the platform's philosophy of considered minimalism meets the practical demands of modern computing, resulting in a memory architecture that is both powerful and approachable. Drawing upon decades of experience with 6502-family systems, this design accommodates everything from simple linear arrangements to sophisticated banking schemes, all whilst maintaining a consistent programming model.

==== Memory Map
At its foundation, every Aves configuration provides a reliable foundation of fixed RAM in the lower half of the addressable space, spanning from address 0x0000 to 0x7FFF. This arrangement ensures compatibility across the entire family of Aves systems whilst providing a stable environment for critical system operations and application workspace.

The upper memory space, however, reveals the true versatility of the architecture. Here, the three distinct approaches to memory organisation serve different needs whilst maintaining compatibility with their siblings. The simplest arrangement implements a straightforward linear EPROM occupying the space from 0x8000 to 0xFDFF, providing 31.5K of program storage, maximimising the availability of memory and utilising the most popular memory sizes available.

For more demanding applications, a sophisticated banking scheme allows this same 31.5K space to accommodate both a 128K Flash EEPROM and 128K of banked RAM. This configuration proves particularly valuable in scenarios requiring rapid context switching or managing multiple concurrent tasks.

The most advanced memory configuration introduces a segmented architecture, managing 512K of RAM alongside 128K of Flash EEPROM. This arrangement maintains compatibility with simpler configurations by presenting a linear architecture in its initial segment, whilst providing expanded capabilities for more sophisticated applications.

A single 8-bit register provides control of the banked memory and provides a mechanism for memory and I/O overlays. 

==== Bank Switching
Bank switching is accomplished using a single 8-bit register to control the content of the upper memory area (0x8000-0xFDFF). MCR is a write only register, that should only be written to from outside the upper memory area.

==== Memory Types and Configurations
The Aves platform supports a diverse range of memory technologies to accommodate different use cases and requirements. At its foundation, the system employs high-speed CMOS technology for optimal performance and power efficiency. For primary system memory, 8-bit wide Static RAM provides reliable and fast access times with straightforward interfacing requirements.

Program storage can be implemented through either 8-bit wide UV erasable EPROM for permanent installations, or 8-bit wide FLASH EEPROM for higher capacity requirements. For specialised applications requiring simultaneous access from multiple memory busses, 8-bit wide dual port static RAM is supported, enabling efficient data sharing.

This flexibility in memory configuration allows system designers to optimise their builds for specific requirements, whether prioritising cost, performance, or functionality.

=== Bus Architecture
The Aves platform's bus architecture exemplifies its commitment to flexibility and scalability while maintaining operational simplicity. From straightforward single-CPU configurations to sophisticated dual-processor arrangements, the bus structure adapts to support various processing needs without compromising system integrity or performance.

At its most basic, the architecture provides a clean, linear bus design optimised for the R65C02, or W65C02 offering direct memory access and predictable timing characteristics. This foundation evolves through increasingly sophisticated implementations, including banked and segmented arrangements for enhanced memory management, culminating in dual-CPU configurations that enable parallel processing capabilities.

Each bus configuration maintains compatibility with the platform's core I/O systems while providing specific advantages for different use cases. The following sections detail these implementations, from fundamental single-CPU arrangements to advanced multi-processor configurations.

.Bus Architecture Configurations
[%header, cols="2,3"]
|===
|Bus Type|Description

|Single Linear Bus
|Basic configuration providing direct address space access with predictable timing characteristics. Supports up to 64K of directly addressable memory with no banking or segmentation.

|Shared Banked Bus
|Configuration designed for DMA controllers and video display systems, allowing direct memory access without CPU intervention. Multiple devices can access memory banks while maintaining CPU operation, particularly useful for video frame buffers and higfh-speed data transfers.

|Segmented Bus
|Memory management scheme dividing address space into segments, providing flexibility in memory allocation while maintaining straightforward programming model. Commonly used in systems requiring more than 64K of addressable space.

|Dual CPU Bus
|Specialised configuration enabling two processors to share memory space through dual-port RAM. Each processor maintains independent bus timing and width,  while using their own resources in isolation. Data and commands is shared between them using the Dual port RAM.

=== I/O Ports
All Aves models support the same set of I/O ports of two industry standard serial ports, a custom shift register based serial bus and a parallel memory mapped I/O expansion bus. All of the serial interfaces are implemented on a single W65C22.

==== I/O Memory Map 
I/O is directly mapped into the processors 64K memory map, the Aves architecture reserves the top 256 bytes of the address space (0xFF00-0xFFFF) for reset vectors, interrupt handing, and bank switching. the next 256 bytes (0xFE00-0xFEFF) is reserved for I/O devices

The next two 256 bytes areas between  0xFC00-0xDFF can also be enabled for I/O access using bits 6 and 5 in the MCR. 

The area from 0xE000-0xEFFF can also be reserved for dual port memory, and is selected using bit 5 of the MCR

|===

==== I2C Interface
The I2C interface is implemented in software using PA0 of the VIA for SCL and PA7 for SDA. This arrangement provides optimal bit manipulation capabilities, as testing bit 7 with the BIT instruction will directly affect the processor's N flag for efficient state testing. Both lines require external 4.7kΩ pull-up resistors to VCC to ensure proper signal levels and to meet I2C bus specifications.

The implementation leverages specific characteristics of the 65C02 instruction set. The lines are manipulated using the data direction register to create a pseudo open-drain configuration - setting a pin as input allows it to float high via the pull-up resistor, while setting it as output drives it low. Start conditions are generated by transitioning SDA from high to low while SCL is high, with stop conditions created by the opposite transition. Clock generation employs increment and decrement instructions for precise timing control, while the BIT instruction enables rapid testing of PA7's state through the N flag.

The interface supports standard mode I2C operation at 100 kHz, with timing managed through software delays calibrated to the system clock frequency. Clock stretching is supported through continuous monitoring of the SCL line state, allowing compatibility with slower I2C peripheral devices. Multi-master mode is not supported.

==== SPI Interface
The SPI interface is implemented in firmware, as modes 0 and 3 only. As with the I2C interface the clock; SCK is implemented on PB0, PB1-PB3 contains the device number and is decoded with a 74HC138 decoder to provide 7 device selects ss1-ss7.

MOSI uses PB6 and MISO PB7. 

SPI is level converted to 3.3V for compatibility with most SPI memory and IO devices.

==== Aves Serial Bus (ASB)
The Aves serial bus uses the VIA shift register to implement a half duplex serial protocol, that is substantially faster than Commodore's propitiatory Serial bus (frequently incorrectly referred to as IEC). The VIA's CAn lines are used as handshake lines. PA6 is used to determine if the bus is transmitting or receiving

==== PS/2 Keyboard Interface
The PS/2 Keyboard interface is based on Ben Eater's PS/2 keyboard interface design, which uses 74HC595 shift registers. Unlike Ben's implementation, data is read directly from the register's parallel output, freeing up 8 additional I/O lines on the VIA. The interrupt logic remains unchanged, using the VIA's CA1 input to detect incoming data.

==== I/O expansion port 
The I/O expansion port is presented on a 34 pin right angle male header, it comprises the 8 x data lines, 12 x address lines, 4 x select lines, RnW, Phi2, RESETb, IRQb, power and gnd.
