== Introduction
The Aves hardware platform represents a flexible and extensible 8/16-bit computer architecture designed to bridge classic computing with modern interfaces and capabilities. Named after the taxonomic class of birds, Aves embodies both elegance and adaptability in its design.

This system supports multiple processor configurations, from the classic R65C02 to the more advanced W65816, with options for dual-processor arrangements incorporating the V25. The architecture accommodates various memory configurations, from simple linear addressing to sophisticated bank-switched and segmented memory layouts, providing up to 2MB of addressable space.

At its core, Aves combines the simplicity and reliability of 8-bit systems with some of the expandability of contemporary systems. The platform features a versatile I/O subsystem built around the W65C22 VIA, supporting multiple communication protocols including I2C, SPI, and the custom Aves Serial Bus (ASB).

This hardware reference manual provides comprehensive documentation of the Aves system architecture, memory configurations, bus arrangements, and interface specifications. It serves as the authoritative reference for hardware developers, system programmers, and enthusiasts working with the Aves platform.

== System Architecture
The Aves platform's architectural heritage stems from the remarkable family of Commodore 8-bit and 16-bit computers, drawing particular inspiration from the CBM8096, Commodore 64 and Plus/4 machines. Whilst these classic designs laid the groundwork, Aves refines and modernises their most successful elements into a cohesive and elegant architecture.

At the heart of every Aves system lies a philosophy of considered minimalism, where each component serves multiple purposes through clever design rather than brute-force complexity. This approach manifests most notably in the memory management and I/O subsystems, where time-tested concepts from the Commodore machines have been thoughtfully reimagined.

The memory architecture pays homage to the innovative bank-switching schemes of its forebears. Where the CBM8096 introduced upper memory banking, and the Commodore 64 demonstrated the flexibility of ROM overlay techniques, Aves unifies these concepts into a sophisticated yet straightforward memory management system. This arrangement provides remarkable flexibility whilst maintaining compatibility with traditional software design patterns.

Perhaps the most significant departure from tradition lies in the I/O subsystem. Where Commodore machines typically employed multiple interface adapters—CIAs, PIAs, and various custom chips—Aves consolidates these functions into a carefully orchestrated arrangement centred on the W65C22 VIA. This consolidation does not represent a compromise but rather an elegant solution that reduces complexity whilst expanding capabilities.

The VIA implementation demonstrates the platform's pragmatic approach to modernisation. Through thoughtful programming of this versatile chip, Aves achieves compatibility with contemporary interfaces such as I2C and SPI, whilst also supporting a custom high-speed serial protocol, the Aves Serial Bus (ASB). This bus draws inspiration from the efficiency of Commodore's serial bus architecture whilst eliminating its notorious timing dependencies.

Throughout the system, one finds this pattern of respectful modernisation. The hardware banking mechanisms, whilst more sophisticated than their predecessors, maintain familiar programming paradigms. The interrupt handling system, though more capable than the original Commodore implementations, remains straightforward and predictable. Even the most advanced configurations, supporting the 16-bit W65816 processor, retain compatibility with their 8-bit siblings through carefully considered hardware abstractions.

This architectural philosophy extends to the physical design as well. The circuit board layouts, component selection, and signal routing all reflect a balance between simplicity and capability. Modern manufacturing techniques and components are employed where beneficial, yet the system remains accessible to hobbyist construction and modification, maintaining the spirit of its predecessors.

=== Processor Options
Aves offers a choice of 8 and 16 bit CPUs within a common architecture. Use of a CPU for I/O operations maximises the re-use of Kernal code and simplifies the task of supporting multiple architectures. All CPUs are CMOS variants consume less power and run at speed of at least 4MHz.

.Supported CPU Types
[%header, cols="2,3"]
|===
|CPU|Description

|R65C02
|The Rockwell R65C02 is no longer in production, but is widely available as new old stock. It is used in several Aves models and  is always clocked at 4MHz. The R65C02 is pin compatible with the original MOS 6502, which was fabricated in NMOS. One of many advantages the 65C02 has over its NMOS sibling is an enhanced instruction set

|WDC65C02
|The Western Design Center WDC65C02 is currently in production. WDC were the creators of the CPU core used in the R65C02, and the WDC65C02 is later version of this core. The same instruction set is used but the CPU it can be run at 14MHz, is fully static and can has tri-state address and data bus lines. A new WAI instruction stops the CPU clock and reduces power to a minimum, it will restart when an interrupt occurs

|WDC65816
|The Western design center WDC65816 is a 16 bit variant of the WDC65C02 with an 8 bit emulation mode as well as 24 bit segmented address bus. The WDC65C816 has a maximum clock speed of 14MHz

|NEC V25 and V35
|The NEC (now Renesas) V25 and V35 are CMOS variants of the Intel 8088 and 8086 respectively, with integrated UARTs, Timers, GPIO and DMA. The V25 has an 8 bit data bus and the V35 has a 16 biot bus both have a 20 bit address bus. which uses the same segmented strategy used by Intel

|MC68HC000
|The Motorola MC68HC000 highly successful and well regarded CPU, was used to power the Commodore Amiga and Atari ST computers. Its architecture and performance were a breakthrough, and this CPU is adopted to pay homage to such an innovation. 

The MC68HC000 had a 32 bit addressing capability with 24 bit address bus width. It has a maximum clock speed of 10MHz, and has a dual mode CPU bus timing that supports older 6800 and 6500 8 bit peripherals, as well as an updated asynchronous native bus. 

|Z16C00
|The Z16C01 is a CMOS version of the Zilog Z8001 CPU, and is included as a curiosity and acknowledgment of the Commodore C900 Zilog Z8001 based "UNIX machine" prototype. The Z8001 was another 16 bit CPU that was developed at around the same time as the Intel 8086 and Motorola 68000. The Z8001 used a 24 bit segmented architecture, although only 23 bits where available on the address bus. The Z16C01 has a maximum clock frequency of 10MHz

=== Memory Architecture
The elegant simplicity of the Aves architecture finds perhaps its clearest expression in its memory management system. Here, the platform's philosophy of considered minimalism meets the practical demands of modern computing, resulting in a memory architecture that is both powerful and approachable. Drawing upon decades of experience with 6502-family systems, this design accommodates everything from simple linear arrangements to sophisticated banking schemes, all whilst maintaining a consistent programming model.

==== Memory Map
At its foundation, every Aves configuration provides a reliable foundation of fixed RAM in the lower half of the addressable space, spanning from address 0x0000 to 0x7FFF. This arrangement ensures compatibility across the entire family of Aves systems whilst providing a stable environment for critical system operations and application workspace.

The upper memory space, however, reveals the true versatility of the architecture. Here, the three distinct approaches to memory organisation serve different needs whilst maintaining compatibility with their siblings. The simplest arrangement implements a straightforward linear EPROM occupying the space from 0x8000 to 0xFDFF, providing 31.5K of program storage, maximimising the availability of memory and utilising the most popular memory sizes available.

For more demanding applications, a sophisticated banking scheme allows this same 31.5K space to accommodate both a 128K Flash EEPROM and 128K of banked RAM. This configuration proves particularly valuable in scenarios requiring rapid context switching or managing multiple concurrent tasks.

The most advanced memory configuration introduces a segmented architecture, managing 512K of RAM alongside 128K of Flash EEPROM. This arrangement maintains compatibility with simpler configurations by presenting a linear architecture in its initial segment, whilst providing expanded capabilities for more sophisticated applications.

A single 8 bit register provides control of the banked memory and provides a mechanism for memory and I/O overlays. 

==== Bank Switching
Bank switching is accomplished using a single 8 bit register to control the content of the upper memory area.
