== FLAP Data-Link Protocol

=== IEEE488 Command Structure
* LISTEN (0x20 + device) - Assigns device as data receiver
* TALK (0x40 + device) - Assigns device as data transmitter
* UNLISTEN (0x3F) - Releases all devices from listen mode
* UNTALK (0x5F) - Releases current talker

=== Connection Management
==== Establishing Connection
1. Controller sends LISTEN command to target device(s)
2. Controller sends TALK command to source device
3. Data transfer can begin

==== Terminating Connection
1. Controller sends UNLISTEN to release listeners
2. Controller sends UNTALK to release talker
3. Bus returns to idle state

=== Device Addressing
* Device addresses: 0-14 (4 bits)
* Address 15 reserved
* Commands: Upper 2 bits define command type
* Lower 4 bits contain device address

=== Protocol Features
* Clear command structure
* Deterministic bus control
* Multiple listener support
* Single talker at a time

=== Responder Device States

==== State Transitions
[graphviz]
----
digraph responder_states {
    idle [label="IDLE"]
    talking [label="TALKING"]
    listening [label="LISTENING"]

    idle -> talking [label="TALK"]
    idle -> listening [label="LISTEN"]
    
    talking -> talking [label="send data"]
    talking -> idle [label="UNTALK"]
    
    listening -> listening [label="receive data"]
    listening -> idle [label="UNLISTEN"]
}
----

==== State Descriptions
* IDLE
** Default state
** Monitors bus for TALK/LISTEN commands
** Only responds to commands matching its address

* TALKING
** Enabled to transmit data
** Maintains state until UNTALK received
** Controls data flow with handshaking

* LISTENING
** Accepts incoming data
** Maintains state until UNLISTEN received
** Acknowledges received data

==== Transition Rules
* Only one device can be in TALKING state at a time
* Multiple devices can be in LISTENING state
* All state changes initiated by controller
* Device returns to IDLE on bus reset

=== Controller Device States

==== State Transitions
[graphviz]

digraph controller_states {
    idle [label="IDLE"]
    talking [label="TALKING"]
    turnaround [label="TURNAROUND"]
    listening [label="LISTENING"]

    idle -> talking [label="TALK"]
    idle -> turnaround [label="LISTEN"]
    
    talking -> talking [label="send"]
    talking -> idle [label="UNTALK"]
    
    turnaround -> listening [label="ready"]
    
    listening -> listening [label="receive"]
    listening -> idle [label="UNLISTEN"]
}
----

==== State Descriptions
* IDLE
** Default bus state
** Ready to initiate commands
** No active transfers

* TALKING
** Controller is sending data
** Maintains state for multiple sends
** Returns to IDLE via UNTALK

* TURNAROUND
** Transitional state between IDLE and LISTENING
** Preparing bus for receive operation
** Transitions to LISTENING when ready

* LISTENING
** Controller receiving data
** Can receive multiple data bytes
** Returns to IDLE via UNLISTEN

==== Transition Rules
* All transfers start from IDLE
* TURNAROUND required before LISTENING
* Self-loops on TALKING/LISTENING for data transfer
* Clean return to IDLE via UNTALK/UNLISTEN

=== Controller Transaction Protocol

1. Send ATN pulse
2. Wait for ACK Pulse

==== Protocol Features
* ATN pulse signaling for synchronization
* Handshake acknowledgment required
* Clear state transitions
* Explicit end-of-transmission handling
* Separate paths for transmit/listen completion

=== Protocol Performance Comparison

==== Commodore Serial (IEC)
* Clock rate: ~1 bit/ms typical
* Byte transfer: ~8-10ms per byte
* Effective transfer rate: ~100-125 bytes/second
* Limited by software bit-banging and long settling times

==== ASB Protocol
* Timeout boundary: 100µs per handshake
* Minimum theoretical throughput: ~5KB/second
* Practical transfer rates: 
** ~2-3KB/second typical
** Up to 10KB/second possible with optimized code
* Hardware-assisted handshaking via VIA
* 20-30x faster than Commodore serial typical case

==== Key Differences
* ASB uses hardware handshaking vs IEC software timing
* ASB transfers full bytes vs IEC bit-by-bit transfer
* ASB timeout is worst-case vs IEC being typical case
* ASB self-paces to device capabilities vs IEC fixed timing
* Both protocols support multiple devices but ASB allows higher device count (15 vs 8)

=== Bus Turnaround

==== Timing Characteristics
* Self-pacing through handshake acknowledgment
* No fixed timing requirement
* 100µs timeout as worst-case boundary
* Actual speed determined by device capabilities

==== Turnaround Sequence
1. Controller initiates turnaround
2. Waits for device acknowledgment
3. Device signals ready state
4. Transfer proceeds at negotiated pace

==== Implementation Benefits
* Natural speed matching between devices
* No artificial delays required
* Robust operation across different device speeds
* Consistent with overall protocol philosophy
* Same timeout boundary as other operations (100µs)

==== Performance Considerations
* Turnaround overhead minimized through self-pacing
* No need for fixed delay loops
* System automatically finds optimal timing
* Reliable operation without performance penalty

=== Controller Transaction Protocol

=== Error Recovery

==== Error Types
* Initialization Timeout
** No devices responding error
** Occurs during initial ATN/ACK sequence
** Indicates no active devices on bus

* Device Command Timeout
** Device <n> not responding error
** Occurs during LISTEN, UNLISTEN, TALK, or UNTALK commands
** Indicates specific device failure or absence

* Transaction Timeout
** General timeout error
** Occurs during data transfer or turnaround
** Indicates communication failure during active transaction

==== Error Recovery Process
1. Error condition detected (>100µs timeout)
2. Both controller and responder:
   * Raise appropriate error type
   * Abort current transaction
   * Return to IDLE state

==== Implementation Benefits
* Error type indicates failure point
* Specific device identification when relevant
* Consistent recovery mechanism for all errors
* Enables targeted retry strategies

==== State Recovery
* All devices return to IDLE regardless of error type
* Higher layers can implement appropriate retry logic based on error type
* New transactions can begin immediately after timeout

=== Frame Format

==== Structure
* Command byte (1 byte)
* Length byte (1 byte, 0-255)
* Data payload (length bytes)
* CRC-16 (2 bytes, present if length > 0)

==== CRC-16 Specification
* Polynomial: 0x8408 (reversed 0x1021)
* Initial value: 0xFFFF
* Final XOR: 0xFFFF
* Right-shifting implementation
* Calculated over command, length and payload bytes

==== Command Frame (length = 0)
* Command byte
* Length = 0
* No CRC
* No payload

==== Data Frame (length > 0)
* Command byte
* Length byte (1-255)
* Data payload (length bytes)
* CRC-16 covering all preceding bytes

=== Bus Protocol States

==== Synchronization
* Every transaction begins with ATN/ACK handshake
* All devices synchronize at start of each transaction
* No edge cases possible - always returns to known state

==== State Management
* Only two primary states:
** IDLE (default state)
** ACTIVE (during transaction)
* All error conditions return to IDLE
* New transaction always starts with synchronization

==== Error Handling
* Timeout (100µs)
** No devices responding (during initialization)
** Device <n> not responding (during addressing)
** General timeout (during transfer)
* CRC error (for data frames)
* All errors return device to IDLE state

==== Design Benefits
* Self-synchronizing protocol
* No ambiguous states possible
* Clean recovery from all error conditions
* Simple, deterministic behavior

=== Reset Sequence

==== Operation
* Sets all devices to IDLE state
* No handshaking required
* No acknowledgment needed

==== Device Response
* Immediate return to IDLE
* Clear any pending transactions
* Ready for new ATN/ACK sequence

That's all there is to it - simplicity is a feature here. The reset provides a clean slate without any complex negotiation or state management.

=== Device States and Initialization

==== Initial State
* All responders start in offline state
* Devices remain offline until ATN/ACK completed
* No bus activity from responders until initialized

==== Initialization Process
1. Controller sends ATN
2. Device responds with ACK
3. Only after successful ATN/ACK:
   * Device becomes active on bus
   * Device can respond to addressed commands

==== Reset Sequence
* Returns devices to offline state
* No handshaking required
* No acknowledgment needed
* Requires new ATN/ACK to become active again

This enforces a clean initialization sequence - devices must explicitly join the bus through ATN/ACK before participating in any transactions. Would you like me to expand on any aspect of this initialization process?
