= ASB Protocol Design Notes

== Foundational Influences
Garth Wilson's work has influenced multiple aspects of Aves:

=== Physical Layer Solutions
* VIA shift register timing fixes
* I2C implementation principles 
* SPI interface design patterns

=== Interrupt Handling
* His high-level Forth interrupt approach influencing Kingfisher
* Clean separation of hardware and software concerns
* Efficient interrupt processing

== Physical Layer Specification

=== Physical Characteristics
* Half duplex communication using 65C22 VIA
* System clock (Phi2) requirement: 4MHz minimum
* Maximum data rate: 1Mbps

=== Hardware Implementation
* Pulsed handshake using edge-sensitive CA1/CA2 I/O
* External tristate buffers for I/O direction control
* Clock synchronization via Phi2-clocked latch

=== Network Topology
* Single controller architecture
* Supports up to 15 responder devices
* Each device uniquely addressable

=== Data Transfer
* Byte-by-byte transmission
* Each byte requires handshake acknowledgment
* Self-pacing through ACK mechanism
* No fixed timing requirements between bytes

=== Reliability Features
* Edge-triggered handshaking
* Hardware flow control via ACK
* Automatic speed matching to receiver capabilities
* Robust clock synchronization

== FLAP Data-Link Protocol

=== IEEE488 Command Structure
* LISTEN (0x20 + device) - Assigns device as data receiver
* TALK (0x40 + device) - Assigns device as data transmitter
* UNLISTEN (0x3F) - Releases all devices from listen mode
* UNTALK (0x5F) - Releases current talker

=== Connection Management
==== Establishing Connection
1. Controller sends LISTEN command to target device(s)
2. Controller sends TALK command to source device
3. Data transfer can begin

==== Terminating Connection
1. Controller sends UNLISTEN to release listeners
2. Controller sends UNTALK to release talker
3. Bus returns to idle state

=== Device Addressing
* Device addresses: 0-14 (4 bits)
* Address 15 reserved
* Commands: Upper 2 bits define command type
* Lower 4 bits contain device address

=== Protocol Features
* Clear command structure
* Deterministic bus control
* Multiple listener support
* Single talker at a time




=== Protocol Performance Comparison

==== Commodore Serial (IEC)
* Clock rate: ~1 bit/ms typical
* Byte transfer: ~8-10ms per byte
* Effective transfer rate: ~100-125 bytes/second
* Limited by software bit-banging and long settling times

==== ASB Protocol
* Timeout boundary: 100µs per handshake
* Minimum theoretical throughput: ~5KB/second
* Practical transfer rates: 
** ~2-3KB/second typical
** Up to 10KB/second possible with optimized code
* Hardware-assisted handshaking via VIA
* 20-30x faster than Commodore serial typical case

==== Key Differences
* ASB uses hardware handshaking vs IEC software timing
* ASB transfers full bytes vs IEC bit-by-bit transfer
* ASB timeout is worst-case vs IEC being typical case
* ASB self-paces to device capabilities vs IEC fixed timing
* Both protocols support multiple devices but ASB allows higher device count (15 vs 8)

=== Bus Turnaround

==== Timing Characteristics
* Self-pacing through handshake acknowledgment
* No fixed timing requirement
* 100µs timeout as worst-case boundary
* Actual speed determined by device capabilities

==== Turnaround Sequence
1. Controller initiates turnaround
2. Waits for device acknowledgment
3. Device signals ready state
4. Transfer proceeds at negotiated pace

==== Implementation Benefits
* Natural speed matching between devices
* No artificial delays required
* Robust operation across different device speeds
* Consistent with overall protocol philosophy
* Same timeout boundary as other operations (100µs)

==== Performance Considerations
* Turnaround overhead minimized through self-pacing
* No need for fixed delay loops
* System automatically finds optimal timing
* Reliable operation without performance penalty

=== Frame Format

==== Structure
* Command byte (1 byte)
* Length byte (1 byte, 0-255)
* Data payload (length bytes)
* CRC-16 (2 bytes, present if length > 0)
  - Covers all preceding bytes (command, length, and payload)
  - Always placed at end of frame
  - Omitted for zero-length frames

==== Frame Types

===== Command Frame (length = 0)
* Command byte
* Length = 0
* No payload
* No CRC

===== Data Frame (length > 0)
* Command byte
* Length byte (1-255)
* Data payload (length bytes)
* CRC-16 covering all preceding bytes

==== CRC-16 Specification
* Polynomial: 0x8408 (reversed 0x1021)
* Initial value: 0xFFFF
* Final XOR: 0xFFFF
* Right-shifting implementation
* Calculated over all frame bytes before CRC

=== Bus Protocol States

==== Synchronization
* Every transaction begins with ATN/ACK handshake
* All devices synchronize at start of each transaction
* No edge cases possible - always returns to known state

==== State Management
* Only two primary states:
** IDLE (default state)
** ACTIVE (during transaction)
* All error conditions return to IDLE
* New transaction always starts with synchronization

==== Design Benefits
* Self-synchronizing protocol
* No ambiguous states possible
* Clean recovery from all error conditions
* Simple, deterministic behavior

=== Reset Sequence

==== Operation
* Sets all devices to IDLE state
* No handshaking required
* No acknowledgment needed

==== Device Response
* Immediate return to IDLE
* Clear any pending transactions
* Ready for new ATN/ACK sequence

That's all there is to it - simplicity is a feature here. The reset provides a clean slate without any complex negotiation or state management.
