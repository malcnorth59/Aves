== FLAP Data-Link Protocol

=== IEEE488 Command Structure
* LISTEN (0x20 + device) - Assigns device as data receiver
* TALK (0x40 + device) - Assigns device as data transmitter
* UNLISTEN (0x3F) - Releases all devices from listen mode
* UNTALK (0x5F) - Releases current talker

=== Connection Management
==== Establishing Connection
1. Controller sends LISTEN command to target device(s)
2. Controller sends TALK command to source device
3. Data transfer can begin

==== Terminating Connection
1. Controller sends UNLISTEN to release listeners
2. Controller sends UNTALK to release talker
3. Bus returns to idle state

=== Device Addressing
* Device addresses: 0-14 (4 bits)
* Address 15 reserved
* Commands: Upper 2 bits define command type
* Lower 4 bits contain device address

=== Protocol Features
* Clear command structure
* Deterministic bus control
* Multiple listener support
* Single talker at a time
